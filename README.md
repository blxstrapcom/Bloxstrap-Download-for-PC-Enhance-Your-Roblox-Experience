# *Why Choose Bloxstrap Bootstrapper?*

Bloxstrap is available exclusively for Windows users. Currently, it does not support Mac or mobile devices. Before installing, keep in mind that it requires the Microsoft .NET framework, which the installation process will automatically prompt you to download if it's not already installed on your system.

This bootstrapper stands out because of its attention to detail, ease of use, and innovative features that let you personalize your Roblox client like never before. It's not just a replacement for the standard launcher — it's a serious upgrade.

# Key Features of Bloxstrap

Bloxstrap offers several high-quality features that make it one of the best tools available for Roblox players:

# *1. Discord Integration*
Connect your Roblox gaming sessions with Discord effortlessly. Bloxstrap integrates with Discord to show your friends what game you're currently playing, complete with the game's thumbnail and description. It's a great way to share your activity with your Discord community and let others join in the fun.

# 2. *Server Location Display*
Ever wonder where your game server is located? Bloxstrap provides this information directly in-game, giving you more insight into your connection quality and helping you make better decisions for smoother gameplay.

# *3. Apply Custom Mods*
Bloxstrap allows you to apply custom modifications to your Roblox client. You can bring back nostalgic elements like the old death sound, use the 2013 or 2016 cursor styles, or even select your favorite fonts. Plus, you can easily manage and apply your own mods by replacing specific files in the Bloxstrap directory.

# 4. *Fast Flags Editor*
This feature enables powerful control over Roblox's internal settings. You can enable exclusive fullscreen mode (allowing multitasking even in full screen) and fix scaling issues when your display scale is set above 100%. These tweaks ensure a smoother, more comfortable gameplay experience.

# *5. Custom FPS Cap*
If you're tired of Roblox's default FPS cap, Bloxstrap lets you unlock it. However, users should be cautious — enabling this feature might affect performance, battery life, or game stability in certain situations.
